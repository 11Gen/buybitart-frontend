The picture shows space looking awesome, like the digital money world is huge. There’s a big explosion thing too, showing how Bitcoin shakes up things, like when stars are born.</p>

                  The United States of America has many symbols – a star-striped flag, the Statue of Liberty, Hollywood and many others. I believe that the main symbol of the world is BITCOIN! Here, in confirmation of this conviction, I created a series of works with the general name «BITCOIN-SYMBOL OF THE MODERN WORLD»<br/><br/>
                  I’m pleased to present to you my sculptures «BITCOIN-SYMBOL OF THE MODERN WORLD», depicting a typical digital representation of the currency, but with a special twist!
                  One of the hallmarks of my work is taking objects from the digital realm and illustrating them using interesting material like coins « Denarium Bitcoin».<br/>
                  Bitcoin offer independence from the monopolistic pyramid scheme of tyranny and should be embraced by freedom loving people everywhere.<br/><br/>
                  I used a jeweler’s saw to cut precise notches in coins from currencies «Denarium Bitcoin» and then joined them together in several geometric forms.<br/><br/>
                  
                  Material: 50 pcs. coins «Denarium Bitcoin»<br/><br/>

    description: `<p>The «Bitcoin Tower» symbolizes the fortress, inviolability and the desire for absolute freedom! Thus, the tower means the opportunity to rise above the situation, look at it from a height, see it completely, which will allow you to assess all aspects of what is happening and make the right decision. Looking at the situation or something from above, the observed becomes visible in the palm of your hand. The tower embodies the clarity of the eye and the clarity of consciousness, as well as the freedom of choice!<br/><br/>
                  «Bitcoin Tower» is a symbol of promotion and success! The tower stands as a symbol of active promotion to the top, despite the obstacles of the state, banks and other people. This is a symbol of a new thinking of a person, a statement in a new status!<br/><br/>
                  On a wooden stand, I drew different symbols, formulas for financial success! (THE MAGICKAL USES OF RUNES – are an alphabetic script used by the peoples of Northern Europe from the first century C.E. until well into the Middle Ages. In addition to their use as a written alphabet, the runes also were a system of symbols used for magic and divination).<br/><br/>
                  Runes are loaded with power. I also draw them in different places — on my car for safety in travel, on the doorpost of my home for protection, on flower pots to aid in the growth of plants. The list of possibilities is endless.<br/><br/>
                  On a wooden stand I painted the “Flower of Prosperity” rune to attract good luck and financial well-being!<br/><br/>
